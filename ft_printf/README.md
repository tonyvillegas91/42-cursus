# ft_printf

## Description

The ft_printf project from school 42 is a custom implementation of the `printf' function in C. The `printf' function is a standard C library function used to print formatted text and variables to the console. This project involves creating a simplified and efficient version of `printf` with certain conversions and formatting options.

## Goals

1. **Manage format specifiers:**.
   - Implement conversions for characters, strings, integers, pointers, etc.
   - Handle format specifiers such as `%s`, `%d`, `%c`, `%p`, etc.

2. **Field and modifier lengths:**.
   - Support for field lengths and modifiers such as `h`, `l`, `hh`, `ll`.

3. **Width and precision options:** **Width and precision options
   - Handle width and precision options in formatting, such as `%5d`, `%.2f`, etc.

4. **Special conversions:**.
   - Support for specific conversions, such as `%n' for the number of characters printed so far.

5. **Flag management:**.
   - Manage flags such as `+`, `-`, `0`, `#`, and spaces.
