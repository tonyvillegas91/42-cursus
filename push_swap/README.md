# push_swap

## Description

The push_swap project at school 42 consists of implementing an efficient algorithm that sorts a stack of numbers using a limited set of operations on two stacks. The goal is to sort the initial stack in ascending order.

## Goals.

1. **Efficient implementation:**
   - Design an efficient algorithm that sorts the stack using as few operations as possible.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Implement a visualization option to graphically display the operations performed.

3. **Limited operations:**
   - Use a limited set of operations on stacks, such as `sa`, `sb`, `ss`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, `rr`, `rra`, `rrb`, and `rrrr`.

4. **Error Management:**
   - Correctly handle errors that may occur during execution.

5. **Optimization:**
   - Optimize the algorithm to efficiently handle large and small stacks.
