# FdF

## Description

School 42's FdF project is a 3D graphical map viewer that uses the school's graphics library, such as mlx. The program reads data from a file containing information about the height of points on a map and creates a 3D visual representation using lines connecting these points.

## Objectives.

1. **Graphical Interface:**
   - Create a graphical interface using the school's graphical library (mlx).

2. **Reading Data:**
   - Read a data file to obtain information about the height of points on the map.

3. **Projections:**
   - Implement at least two projections (isometric and orthographic) to visualize the map in 3D.

4. **Colors:**
   - Assign colors to the lines according to the height of the points to improve visual readability.

5. **User Controls:** 
    - Allow user interaction, such as adjusting the height or rotating the points.
