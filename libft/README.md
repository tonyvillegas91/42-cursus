# libft

## Description

The school 42 libft project is the implementation of a custom library of standard functions in C. This library provides a collection of useful functions that can be used in future projects in place of the standard C library functions.

## Goals.

1. **Standard Library Functions:**.
   - Implement standard C library functions such as `memset`, `bzero`, `memcpy`, `memccpy`, etc.

2. **Additional functions:**.
   - Create additional functions that are not in the standard library but are useful, such as string manipulation, linked lists, etc.

3. **Dynamic memory handling:** ** Develop functions for dynamic memory handling.
   - Develop functions for dynamic memory handling, such as `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`, etc.

4. **Conversion functions:**.
   - Implement conversion functions, such as `atoi`, `itoa`, etc.

5. **Basic math functions:** ** Include basic math functions like `absorbs`, `toa`, etc.
   - Include basic math functions such as `abs`, `power`, etc.
